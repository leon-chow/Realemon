# Realmon

**This game is still in Alpha and has many bugs. Although, it is a turn-based text game that will feature real world jobs as different classes that the
user can play as. The player takes turns with the enemies to select an attack to use on the enemy. Story, extra moves and loading a game will 
added in future releases, if I have plans to work on this project again. However, this game may be scrapped altogether and used as inspiration 
for any future games that I might make.**

# How to play

Assuming that you have **Ant and JDK** installed, to play this game, you can clone the repository and run following commands in the same directory:
1. `ant compile`
2. `ant run`

If you do not **Ant** installed, you can manually compile all the game files with `javac "file".java` 

Optionally, you can also run the game by typing cloning the repo and typing `java -jar RealmonV1.0.jar`

# Limitations

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am currently unable to work on the game now and I do not know when I will be able to get back to work on this game. 

# Notice

This game was made entirely for fun and as a learning experience. This game draws some inspiration from pre-existing games like Pokemon, but is not endorsed by Nintendo™, Creatures™, Game Freak™, The Pokémon Company™
